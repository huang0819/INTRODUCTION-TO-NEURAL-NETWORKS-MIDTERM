## House price prediction
* The real estate markets, like those in Sydney and Melbourne, present an interesting opportunity for data analysts to analyze and predict where property prices are moving towards. Prediction of property prices is becoming increasingly important and beneficial. Property prices are a good indicator of both the overall market condition and the economic health of a country. 

* Considering the data provided, try to use the neural network to predict the price of estate

## House price prediction
* Customer Churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, in the loss of clients or customers.Bank, insurance companies, streaming services companies and telcom service companies, often use customer churn analysis and customer churn rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining existing customers is far less than acquiring a new one.

This analysis focuses on the behavior of bank customers who are more likely to leave the bank (i.e. close their bank account). I want to find out the most striking behaviors of customers through Exploratory Data Analysis and later on use some of the predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to churn.

* Considering the data provided, try to use the neural network to predict the customers who are most likely to churn.
